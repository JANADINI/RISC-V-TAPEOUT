## What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?

A System-on-Chip (SoC) integrates CPU, memory, communication controllers, and input/output peripherals on a single chip. SoCs power everything from smartphones and IoT devices to embedded controllers.

## Essential SoC Components

### CPU

- The processing core that executes instructions and manages operations.

### Memory

- ROM for firmware/boot code and RAM for programs/data.
- May include cache for faster access.

### Peripherals

- Interfaces for input/output like GPIO, UART, SPI, timers, and DAC/ADC.

### Interconnect

- The data highway connecting all components, typically as a bus or a more advanced network.

---

## Key Design Challenges

- Handling integration complexity across diverse modules.
- Optimizing performance while managing power usage.
- Ensuring hardware security and thorough pre-production verification.
- Meeting development cost and time-to-market demands.

## Types of SoCs

- **Microprocessor SoC:** General-purpose, application-driven (e.g., mobile CPUs).
- **Microcontroller SoC:** Compact and power-efficient for embedded control (e.g., ESP32, ARM Cortex-M).
- **Application-Specific SoC:** Custom hardware for tasks like AI or graphics acceleration.

## SoC Design Flow

1. **Specification & Architecture:** Define system requirements and block diagram.
2. **Functional Modeling:** Simulate at the behavioral level for early design validation.
3. **RTL Design:** Build the hardware using HDLs (like Verilog).
4. **Verification:** Simulate and test for functional correctness.
5. **Physical Design:** Convert design to silicon layout.
6. **Tape-Out:** Fabricate and test the physical chip.
